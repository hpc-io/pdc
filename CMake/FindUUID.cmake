# Find the system's UUID library
# This will define:

# UUID_FOUND - System has UUID
# UUID_INCLUDE_DIRS - The UUID include directory
# UUID_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use UUID

# - Try to find UUID
# Once done this will define
#  UUID_FOUND - System has UUID
#  UUID_INCLUDE_DIRS - The UUID include directories
#  UUID_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use UUID
